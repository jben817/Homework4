Homework 4

Javacript game

Suppose to click start and a timer and game to begin.

I could not get anything to work. The questions wouldn't show up, only the answers. Couldn't fingure out how to get from one question to the next. Had to give up on the timer and the homework in general to turn something in on time.  Apologies in advance.
